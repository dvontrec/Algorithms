# Grading Students

## Grading policy

- every student receives a grade in the inclusive range 0-100
- any grade less than 40 is a failing grade

## Rounding policy

- if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 round up to the next multiple of 5
- if the value of the grade is less than 38 no rounding. the grade fails

## write code to automate the rounding process.

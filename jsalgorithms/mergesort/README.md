# Merge Sort

- Break up the array into halves until you have arrays yjay are empty or have 1 element

- Once we have smaller sorted arrays merge those arrays with other sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until we are back at the full length of the array

- once the array has been merged back togther, return the merged and sorted array
